############## three primary methods growth services######################33 --> (Look for Emphasis on Organic Growth) --ex [Useviral ,Social Viral,Sidesmedia,
1- The Liking Method : 

Then they’ll “like” photos on your behalf posted by those users. Ideally, those people will come to check out your account and then stick around.

The liking method is not without its dangers – too many actions within a certain time span might cause Instagram to ban your account. Some growth services, however, have ways around this. (Useviral )-----> (Buy Instagram Followers , comment , likes , viwe ) per country

2- The Follow/Unfollow Method:

--------------------------------
3- The Auto-Message Method :
There are good points to all three methods that growth services use. But the follow/unfollow and comment/DM practices have too many drawbacks to truly be effective.
